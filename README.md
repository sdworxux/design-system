# SDWorx Design System

### The benefits of a Design System

Some of the benefits of a design system

* **Consistency and cohesion:** Reusing interface elements ensures our products look and feel consistent.
* **Faster workflow:** Organizing our components is like sorting a pile of LEGO: Once you know where all the pieces are and how they can be used, it’s much easier to build what you need.
* **Collaboration:** A Design System gives different team members a common platform to build products together.
* **Shared vocabulary:** When our team speaks a common language, instead of each discipline having their own name for a component, it’s much easier to collaborate with one another.
* **Helpful documentation:** We can use our Design System to teach one another about what our buttons look like, or what styles of typography we use and why.
* **Foundation to expand and improve on:** The Design System is a “living and breathing” entity. It serves as a base that we can adapt or add to as our needs change.
