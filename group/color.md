  colour palette. They ensure visual consistency and are used regardless of the

# Color

## Brand identity colours

The SD Worx brand consists of 4 identity colours: purple, orange, red & yellow.

## Complimentary colour palettes

Sometimes you need more colours than just the identity colours, e.g. charts on dashboards. Therefore we've defined these complementary palettes.  
We matched these with the variables **$primary-**, **$accent-**, **$red-brand-** and **$yellow-brand-** stored in variables.scss.
